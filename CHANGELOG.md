# CHANGELOG 🌟

This document outlines the improvements and changes made to the project, where I meticulously reproduce Basab's analysis of the productivity and efficiency of water utilities using the International Benchmarking Network for Water and Sanitation Utilities (IBNET) dataset. This document 📝 serves as a comprehensive record of all the enhancements, modifications, and updates that have been integrated into our project over time, particularly after the publication of PER report. It includes detailed descriptions of additional data cleaning procedures 🧹, fixes for any bugs 🐛 encountered, expansions in our analytical scope 🔍, and enriched narratives 📖 to better elucidate our findings. The changelog aims to provide stakeholders with a transparent view of the project's evolution, ensuring that every step towards improvement and refinement is clearly documented and easy to follow.
